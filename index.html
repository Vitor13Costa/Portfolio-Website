            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I find the technology world intriguing. I'm fascinatwd when I use
                <br>technology such as my phone, when I play videogames, when I 
                <br>hear about a new AI model an what it can do. It was only a matter
                <br>of time until I started making technology.
                <br><br>Over the last 4 years I have build multiple projects using Java,
                <br>SQL, HTML, JavaScript, etc. I have used my coding knowledge in
                <br>multiple competitions, in and out of school. Coding websites and apps 
                <br>is a passion of mine. I enjoy building real-world solutions that make
                <br>someones's life easier and love seeing my work come to life.
                <br><br>Being creative is something I value deeplu. And while creativity
                <br>has always come naturally to me, I strive to push new boundaries
                <br>with my projects each and every time. Whether in my work life or
                <br>socioal life, I am always striving to grow as a person while keeping
                <br>true to myself. I am a strong Individual contributor, but I also excel
                <br>in team-based environments where collaboration and different
                <br>perspectives can drive innovation. My ultimate goal as I persue
                <br>my career is to use my passion for technology and creativity to
                <br>contribute meaningfully to the world around me.
